# Formidable Labs Project Hub

This is a dynamic list of our open source projects.

## Setup

To install and run the site locally:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your favorite browser.


## Build

To build the JS to the `/dist`, run `npm run build`.

## Notes

Projects are only displayed if they have a homepage. If you want a project to display that doesn't have one, you can add the repo URL as a homepage on GitHub for the same effect.
