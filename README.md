# Formidable Labs Project Hub

This is a dynamic list of our open source projects.

To run it locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```

To build `dist` JS: `npm build`.

## Notes

Projects are only displayed if they have a homepage. If you want a project to display that doesn't have one, you can add the repo URL as a homepage on GitHub for the same effect.
